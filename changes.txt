MDS Changelog:

Revision 5 (big rewrite):
Divorced the Layouts from the Tweening with a new library
Redid the work functions to support ease type functions
Integration of rotation into the tweening functions as standard
Using a 'better' rotation library as standard, 'rotate', which has less of the uneeded features of zoom
Added 3DS support.
Ensured all variables have a healthy set of names corresponding to their purpose
Allowed for setting temporary order overrides, emulating the functionally of "OnTop" variable of older revisions
Restore ability to pick output sizes between Wide and 5x4
Added project to github

Revions 4:
More stuff for R4 from YamiNoSenshi. Thanks YamiNoSenshi!
Added Vertical Mode, just call MDS_SetVerticalMode() And use MDS_Book or MDS_BookGap! Technically works with everything else but uses a 3x multiple - use after SetParams
Added transition effect to go from VertStack to... Vertstack rotated on its side? You probably want to call MDS_BookA afterwards. -
MDS_VStackToRotated and MDS_RotatedToVStack. They have an optional param to select which way to rotate which will be remembered across multiple calls.
Added 'step' params to resize and positioning function, in case this is useful for more advanced functions. Will just be an integer from 0 to 29.
Fixed resize methods for immediate function to match those used in animated (relevant to lower res videos)
Changed the way MDS_AnimFunc and MDS_PositionFunc get called, now they let you change the core animation that's at work, which lets you actually accomplish things by changing them, unlike previous attempts.
Added MDS_DraftSettings and MDS_QualitySettings, which are some presets for blockpreserve and resize filters so that people who don't actually want
  to know every detail of this stupid overengineered system can get smoother (but slower to process) results

Revision 3:  (NB: original Rev 3 has typo, was line 322, has -MDS_QSzY instead of -MDS_QSzX )
Got some ideas of stuff to add for R3 from Admiral H. Curtiss, and Captain Flame Guy, and the Tech Support Crowd helped a bit too
Fixed some stupid bugs with TopO and BottomO
Added in automated better sizing below 1x scale
Add 4th param to most 3 param calls to 'undo'
FlipFlop function?
Create functions that allow you to change additional filters
Add in functions for help with custom transitions

Revision 2:
Have some way to have frame A drawn before frame B, should be pretty easy to do with an eval/default values
Make a function to set the variables yourself and then call functions to perform them
Make some functions that make it easier to perform eg Fades/Dissolves without desyncing the two videos
